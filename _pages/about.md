Hi! This is Hiep. Welcome to my website. 

I am a second-year graduate student at Georgetown with interests in Bayesian Inference, Deep Learning, and Numerical Optimization. While I am not a CS-student, 
I have spent a non-trivial amount of time coding and studying algorithms to be able to follow my passion for machine learning and data science.

This is the place where I will write about AI, statistics and showcase some of my projects (mostly related to AI and data science)
