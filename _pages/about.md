Hi! This is Hiep. Welcome to my website. 

I am currently a Data Scientist at [Logivan Technologies](https://www.logivan.com/). My main task here is to deliver an automated pricing system using deep learning. Previously, I was graduate student in Statistics at Georgetown University. My interests span Bayesian Inference, Deep Learning, and Numerical Optimization. 

While I do not have a computer science degree, I have spent a non-trivial amount of time coding and studying algorithms to be able to follow my passion for machine learning and data science.

This is the place where I will write about AI, statistics and showcase some of my projects (mostly related to AI and data science)
