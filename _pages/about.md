Hi! This is Hiep. Welcome to my website. 

I am currently a Data Scientist at [QuantumBlack](https://www.quantumblack.com/).

Prior to QB, I was a Data Scientist at [Waves](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/waves-vietnam-podcasts) and [Logivan Technologies](https://www.logivan.com/). At Waves, I leveraged NLP and Siamese network to develop a podcasts recommendation system. My main task at Logivan was to deliver an automated pricing system using deep learning. 

I also spent 2 years as a graduate student in Statistics at Georgetown University. My interests in the field span Bayesian Inference, Deep Learning, and Numerical Optimization. 

While I do not have a computer science degree, I have spent a non-trivial amount of time coding and studying algorithms to be able to follow my passion for machine learning and data science.

This is the place where I will write about AI, statistics and showcase some of my projects (mostly related to AI and data science)
