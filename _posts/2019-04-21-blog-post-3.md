Since the size of input after convolving, padding and max-pooling can be tricky, I believe having a formula sheet that keeps track of the shape after each operation will come in handy. So, here we go.

**Convolving Layer**

Let the input X be a matrix of shape $$(batchsize,n_h,n_w,n_c)$$ and F be a filter of shape $$(f_h,f_w,f_{cin},f_{cout})$$, then output of $$X\circledast F$$ will be of shape $$(batchsize,n_h-f_h+1,n_w-f_w+1,f_{cout})$$. Here,
$$f_{cout}$$ can be understood as the number of filters.

Now, consider padding $$p$$ and stride $$s$$. the shape of $$X\circledast F$$ is of shape $$(batchsize,n_h+2*p-f_h+1,n_w+2*p-f_w+1,f_{cout})$$. Normally, we use padding partly because we do not want the input to shrink too drastically after convolving, and would expect the output to have the exact same heigh and weight as those of the input.
Hence, the widely accepted value of $$p_i$$ is $$\frac{f_i-1}{n_i}$$.

**Example 1**

Consider the case with no padding and stride 1.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
input=tf.random_normal([1,200,150,3])
filter=tf.random_normal([5,5,3,32]) #the default shape of filter in tensorflow is [f_h,f_w,fc_in,fc_out]
convo=tf.nn.conv2d(input,filter,strides=[1,1,1,1],padding='VALID') #stride =1 and no padding
with tf.Session() as sess:
	print(sess.run(tf.shape(convo)))
#Output is of shape [  1 196 146  32]
```

Here, 1 and 32 are the batch size and number of filters, respectively. From the formula, $$196=200-5+1$$ and $$146=150-5+1$$.

Now, assume that we use stride>1, that is, we slide the filter more than one step when convolving it with the input. In that case, the shape of the output is going to be $$(batchsize,
\lfloor\frac{(n_h+2p-f_h)}{s}+1\rfloor, \lfloor\frac{(n_w+2p-f_w)}{s}+1\rfloor,f_{cout})$$.

**Example 2**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
input=tf.random_normal([1,200,150,3])
filter=tf.random_normal([5,5,3,32])
convo=tf.nn.conv2d(input,filter,strides=[1,4,4,1],padding='VALID') #stride =4 and no padding
with tf.Session() as sess:
	print(sess.run(tf.shape(convo)))
#Output is of shape [1 49 37 32]
```

Again, 1 and 32 are the batch size and number of filters.  In addition, $$49=\lfloor\frac{200-5}{4}+1\rfloor$$ and $$37=\lfloor\frac{150-5}{4}+1\rfloor$$. Changing the parameter padding to 'SAME' will result in an output with the same height and width as those of the input.

**Pooling Layer**
